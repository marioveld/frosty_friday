# Frosty Friday Challenges

[Frosty Friday][fros] was created by Christopher Marland and Mike Droog.
It is a weekly challenge series
that is all about getting practical Snowflake experience
by solving fun problems!

These are my solutions.
I made a directory for every challenge
with `ffw` plus the week number.
So, **F**rosty **F**riday **W**eek 6 became `ffw6`.
Every solution consists of a README explaining what happens and why
and a SQL file with the actual code.
I tried to make all SQL statements as runnable as possible
in different environments (e.g. mine and yours)
without creating anything permanent inside Snowflake.
Usually, it would just be enough to `USE` 
a role, a database and a warehouse prior to
executing the statements.
Naturally, this cannot always be the case though!
