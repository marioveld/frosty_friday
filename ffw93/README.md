# A solution to Frosty Friday Week 93

[Frosty Friday][fros] is a weekly Snowflake challenge series
created by Christopher Marland and Mike Droog.
These challenges can be a lot of fun so be sure to take a look!

This is my solution to [Frosty Friday Week 93][ffw93].

In this weeks challenge we are asked to query an
official (open) API
from the government of the USA.
You can find the documentation on
[FiscalData API Documentation][fiscaldata].
