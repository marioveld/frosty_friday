# A solution to Frosty Friday Week 7

[Frosty Friday][fros] is a weekly Snowflake challenge series
created by Christopher Marland and Mike Droog.
These challenges can be a lot of fun so be sure to take a look!

This is my solution to [Frosty Friday Week 7][ffw7].
I changed the setup script,
but it should create the same context.
The solution is a query that combines
the *Access History*, *Tag References* and
*Query History* views in the *Account Usage* schema.
I also provided a short version of that query.
